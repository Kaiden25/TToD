##The Concept of the Game
The player enters the fantasy world of the Tower of Doom, where he has to fight his way up
an **8 floor dungeon** called "The Tower of Doom". 

On every floor he has to **fight** a horde of **enemys**, till he gets to the **boss**. Once the boss is
beaten, the player can **break the seal** of the floor and get to the **next floor**.

There is also a **village**, in which the player can **rest**, and **sell/buy items** with the many traders.

##Combat
The Combat-System is round based. In every round the player can **attack**, use an **item**, 
**defend** himself or try to **flee**.

Every Round the player and the enemy do one movement.
